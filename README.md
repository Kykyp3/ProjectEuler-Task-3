# ProjectEuler-Task-3
Largest prime factor

Solutions depend on fundamental theorem of arithmetic,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic

We iterate prime numbers, until we find a smallest prime divisor for N
Find residual multiple of N factors => N / smallest prime factor
Repeat

Fastest algorithm Euler3_fastest, thus broken for square numbers
